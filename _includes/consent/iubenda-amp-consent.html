  File: iubenda-amp-consent.html
  Description: This file integrates the Iubenda consent management system using AMP components. 
               It initializes the consent state and manages user interactions for consent preferences. 
               The consent system is designed to comply with privacy regulations by allowing users 
               to accept or decline cookies.

  Key Components:
  - <amp-consent>: Manages the consent UI, including the consent banner and preference modal.
  - Consent UI: Provides buttons for users to accept all cookies or customize their preferences.
  - Post-Consent UI: Displays a button for users to re-open the consent modal.

  Usage:
  - The consent system is activated based on the environment (production or development mode).
  - The consent UI is displayed as an overlay, and users can interact with it to set their preferences.
  - The system updates the consent state based on user interactions.

  Note: Ensure that the site configuration (e.g., `site.iubenda.remote_consent_url`, `site.iubenda.tp_btn_style`) 
        is correctly set in the Jekyll environment to enable proper functioning of the consent system.
