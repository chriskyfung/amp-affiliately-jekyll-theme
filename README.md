## Writing Posts üìù

You can write posts just as you would in Jekyll, the only difference being that AMP has some strict guidelines on including external content.

You cannot use Markdown format or normal HTML tags. AMP provides its own custom tags for images, videos, etc. For examples,

### üñº Images

Use the `picture.html` template to insert an image in the AMP format with automatically serving the image in the **WebP** format.
The template also wraps the image with a `<figure>` tag with an optional caption element.

```ruby
{% include picture.html img="welcome.jpg" height="400" width="800" %}
```

[OPTIONS](https://chriskyfung.github.io/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme/media/#using-include-picturehtml)

[DEMOS - Image in AMP](https://chriskyfung.github.io/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme/media/#image-in-amp)

### üìπ YouTube Videos

You need to include the following front-matter variable to enable YouTube embeds.

```yaml
amp:
   youtube: true
```

To embed a single video, use the following tag to include the `youtube.html` template.

```ruby
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" title="Welcome to Watch this Video" %}
```

To embed a playlist, you need to set both the _playlist ID_ and the _ID of the first video within the playlist_.

```ruby
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" \
   playlist="<YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_UID>" title="Welcome to Watch this Video" %}
```

### üíª Codes

This theme supports [syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting) based on [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), which is the default highlighter in Jekyll 3 and above. All CSS styles for syntax highlighting stores in the `amp-syntax-highlight.css` under the `_includes/css/` directory.

By default, this theme excludes the CSS styles for syntax highlighting. The AMP framework limits the total CSS styles up to 75,000 bytes per AMP page. This keeps light-weight and rendering fast.

To include the stylesheet on-demand, you need to add the following to your post's front matter:

```yaml
css:
  syntax: true
```

[DEMOS - Code Block](https://chriskyfung.github.io/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme//code)

### üìå Callout - *beta feature*

A shortcode for creating a colored box, e.g. tips/memo.

```ruby
{% capture label %}
   PUT YOUR MARKDOWN CONTENT HERE...
{% endcapture %}

{% include callout.html content=label %}
```

* * *

## Using AMP Components ‚ö°

Some AMP components require you to specify external scripts before using them.
You can specify these scripts in the head.html file in the includes directory after the already imported scripts and then use these components in any post.

[See Full AMP Documentation.](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/)

## Validating Your AMP Pages üêû

AMP provides a built-in validator to validate your pages. You can access this validator by opening the Developer Console in your browser and appending `#development=1` to the end of any URL of your site, e.g. [`http://localhost:4000/#development=1`](http://localhost:4000/#development=1).

If you have errors on your page, AMP will list those for you in the console. If no errors are on your page, you'll get a message "AMP Validation Successful" on the DevTools console.

* * *

## Using Gulp to Run and Optimize Jekyll Build ü•§

Run the following command to install Gulp, AMP Optimizer, and other node packages in the root directory of your project:

```shell
npm install
```

Build Jekyll locally and run the Gulp pipeline with the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

* * *
## Deploying to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions üöÄ

This theme includes Jekyll plugins that are not in the whitelist of Github Pages. If you are going to deploy it to your Github Pages, you need to deploy it via Github Action. The Action workflow is configured in the `/.github/workflows/deploy-jekyll.yml`, which uses [helaili/jekyll-action@v2](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) to build the Jekyll site, run AMP Optimizer and HTML minifier using Gulp, and deploy the optimized build to your `gh-pages` branch.
