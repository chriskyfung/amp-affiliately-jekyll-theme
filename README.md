## What is AMP

AMP stands for [Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/), a Google-backed project designed as an open standard for any publisher to have pages load quickly on mobile devices.

## Installation

There are different ways to install the theme -

### 1. Cloning the repository and updating settings
1. Fork this repository and clone the forked repository.
2. Update the `_config.yml` file as per your requirements.
3. Add your posts to the `_posts` directory.
4. Deploy to your own server or Github Pages (read **Deploying to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions** ).

### 2. Set up as a remote theme and updating settings
1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy.
2. run `bundle install` to install the plugin.
3. Add the following to your site's _config.yml file to activate the plugin
   ```yaml
   plugins:
      - jekyll-remote-theme
   ```
4. Add `remote_theme: chriskyfung/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme` to your _config.yml file to set the site theme.
5. Set site-wide options in your site's_config.yml.

**Note**: You must update the jekyll-remote-theme plugin to v0.4.2 or higher if you use Jekyll 4.0+.

You may also optionally specify a branch, tag, or commit to use by appending an @ and the Git ref (e.g., chriskyfung/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme@v1.2.8). If you don't specify a Git ref, the master branch will be used.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

This theme includes Jekyll plugins that are not in the whitelist of Github Pages. If you are going to deploy it to your Github Pages, you need to deploy it via Github Action. The Action workflow is configured in the /.github/workflows/jekyll.yml which uses [helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.3](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action).  It needs access to a `JEKYLL_PAT` secret set with a Personal Access Token (needs public_repo scope).

## Writing Posts
You can write posts just as you would in Jekyll, the only difference being that AMP has some strict guidelines on including external content.

You cannot use Markdown format or normal HTML tags. AMP provides its own custom tags for images, videos etc...

### Examples -

#### ðŸ–¼ Images

Use the `picture.html` template to insert an image in the AMP format with automatically serving the image in the **WebP** format.
The template also wraps the image with a `<figure>` tag with an optional caption element.

```liquid
{% include picture.html img="welcome.jpg" height="400" width="800" %}
```

Options:
- **alt**
- **caption** (_support HTML codes_)
- **class** (_e.g._ `text-center`)
- **layout** (_amp-img supported layouts_: `fill`, `fixed`, `fixed-height`, `flex-item`, `intrinsic`, `nodisplay` or `responsive`. _default_: `intrinsic`)
- **lightbox** (_default_: `true`)
- **link** (_assign a URL for the HTML \<a\> tag that wraps the \<amp-img\> tag when the key is present_)
- **source** (`assets`, `projects` or `raw`)
  - _default_ - get image from the `/images/posts/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.default` in `_config.yml`)
  - `assets` - get image from the `/assets/images/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.assets` in `_config.yml`)
  - `projects` - get image from the `/images/projects/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.projects` in `_config.yml`)
  - `raw` - get image from the specified URL

#### ðŸ“¹ YouTube Videos

You need to include the following front matter variable to enable YouTube embeds.

```yaml
amp:
   youtube: true
```

To embed a single video, use the following tag to include the `youtube.html` template.

```liquid
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" title="Welcome to Watch this Video" %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_

To embed a playlist, you need to set both the _playlist ID_ and the _ID of first video within the playlist_.

```liquid
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" \
   playlist="<YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_UID>" title="Welcome to Watch this Video" %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **playlist** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_

#### ðŸ’» Codes

This theme supports [syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting) based on [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), which is the default highlighter in Jekyll 3 and above. All CSS styles for syntax highlighting stores in the `amp-syntax-highlight.css` under the `_includes/css/` directory.

By default, this theme excludes the CSS styles for syntax highlighting. The AMP framework limits the total CSS styles up to 75,000 bytes per AMP page. This keeps light-weight and rendering fast.

To include the stylesheet on-demand, you need to add the following to your post's front matter:

```yaml
css:
  syntax: true
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Callout

A shortcode for creating a colored box, e.g. tips/memo.

```liquid
{% capture label %}
   PUT YOUR MARKDOWN CONTENT HERE...
{% endcapture %}

{% include callout.html content=label %}
```

### Front Matters

#### Set Featured Image for a Page/Post

You can assign an image (with **730Ã—431** pixels in size) as the featured image of a post in the front matter like this:

```yaml
image:
   path: /assets/images/cover-image.png
```

##### Create thumbnail images for display in Featured Boxes/Lists

1. Make a copy of each featured image file in the same folder.
2. Rename the copies to have a filename like `<filename>.thumb.<ext>`, _e.g._ `cover-image.thumb.png`.
3. Rescale it to a height of **150px**.

By default, the thumbnail of featured images is cropped at the center inside the cards of the Featured Boxes/Lists. A new variable for the thumbnail positioning was added to the theme on 2020-10-07. You can now change the image position to the _left_ or _right_ by appending a `fit` option to the `image` variable, _e.g._:

```yaml
image:
   path: /assets/images/cover-image.png
   fit: left
```

##### For images that do not have an aspect ratio of 16:9

If the image is not at 16:9 aspect ratio, you need to define it width and height under the `image` variable, _e.g._:

```yaml
image:
   path: /assets/images/cover-image.png
   width: 640
   height: 480
```

##### Hide Featured Image on a Page/Post

If you do not want to render the featured image on the post page, append a `hide` option to the `image` variable, _e.g._:

```yaml
image:
   path: /assets/images/cover-image.png
   hide: true
```

##### Remove Box Shadow from a Featured Image

If you want to remove the shadow of the featured image on the post page, append the following class to the `image` variable, _e.g._

```yaml
image:
   path: /assets/images/cover-image.png
   class: shadow-none
```

#### Pin to Featured Boxes/Lists

```yaml
featured: true
```

##### Set Last Modified Date

```yaml
last_modified_at: 2020-06-20 23:36 +0000`
```

#### Add Custom Codes to HTML Head to a Page/Post

In the front matter, you can add your codes to the HTML header using the variable `custom_header`. For example, include the script for the `amp-accordion` component:

```yaml
custom_head: >-
  <script async custom-element="amp-accordion" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-accordion-0.1.js"></script>
```

#### Add Custom CSS Styles to Header to a Page/Post

In the front matter, you can add your custom CSS styles to the end of the `<style amp-custom>` tag inside the HTML header.

```yaml
css:
   custom: >
      .ml-2 { margin-left: 2rem }
      table { width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; }
```

#### Display Download Buttons in a Post's sidebar

When you use this theme for the Github Pages of a Github project repository, it is available to show a download button or links to the repository in the sidebar of a Post.

To display the button to the project repository, declare the repository name in your `_config.yml`.

```yaml
repository: <USERNAME>/<PROJECT>
```

Also, appending the `download` variable to the post front matter.

```yaml
download: true
```

If a release exists in the repository, an additional button that links to the latest release will be shown.

**Note**: Authentication is required to get your repository data in order to show the release button. Please follow the docs of [jekyll
/github-metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/authentication.md) to set up your personal access token.

You can also override the latest release button by defining a URL under the `download` variable, _e.g._:

```yaml
downlod:
  url: //.../filename.zip
```

### Using AMP Components
Some AMP components require you to specify external scripts before using them.
You can specify these scripts in the head.html file in the includes directory after the already imported scripts and then use these components in any post.

[See Full AMP Documentation.](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/)

## Validating your page with AMP
AMP provides built-in validator to validate your pages so that they can rendered quickly.

You can access this validator by opening the Developer Console in your browser and adding #development=1 to any url of your site.

Example -
http://localhost:4000/#development=1

If you have errors on your page, AMP will list those for you in the console. If you do not have any errors, you'll get a message "AMP Validation Successful" on your console.
