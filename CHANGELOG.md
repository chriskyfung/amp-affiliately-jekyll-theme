## v2.9.1 (2024-03-12)

### üêõ Fixes

- Removed the `data-ampdevmode` attribute from the `<amp-script>` component in non-development environments. This attribute was previously used to enable development-specific features, such as the ability to load scripts from a local server. However, it was found to cause unintended behavior in production environments, such as preventing scripts from running or causing validation errors. By removing this attribute in non-development environments, we ensure that AMP pages are always served with the correct configuration and that scripts are executed as intended.
