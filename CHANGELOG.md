## v2.9.1 (2024-03-12)

### üêõ Fixes

- Removed the `data-ampdevmode` attribute from the `<amp-script>` component in non-development environments. This attribute was previously used to enable development-specific features, such as the ability to load scripts from a local server. However, it was found to cause unintended behavior in production environments, such as preventing scripts from running or causing validation errors. By removing this attribute in non-development environments, we ensure that AMP pages are always served with the correct configuration and that scripts are executed as intended.

### ‚ú® Features

- Introduced two new options to the site configuration:
  - `amp_optimizer`: Set to true if you run AMP Optimizer after building the Jekyll site. Defaults to false.
  - `script_hash`: A hash for the `get_stored_consentStates` script. Defaults to empty.

### üìù Documentation

- Corrected a typo in the `.github-sponsors-button` CSS class, resolving an error.
- Updated badges that were labeled with incorrect version numbers.
- Migrated `<span class="badge ..."">` elements to use the kramdown attribute syntax: `<span>...</span>{:.badge...}`.
- Utilized reference links for inline markdown links in cases where lines become excessively long.
- Inserted a line break after each badge using `<br>` tags.
- Added `<br>` tags to create line breaks before default values.
- Enhanced table styling by applying vertical-align: top to `th` and `td` elements.
- Introduced two new CSS classes, `.blue` and `.green`, to provide additional styling options.
- Appended `.green` to inline code blocks containing the text "true".
- Appended `.blue` to inline code blocks containing non-boolean default values.
- Removed the `.plaintext` CSS class to streamline the styling.

## v2.9.0 (2024-03-08)

### ‚ú® Features

- Added ability to customize the URL for the privacy policy page via the `_config.yml` file.

- Implemented a granular Cookie Consent Notice ([#44](https://github.com/chriskyfung/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme/issues/44)):
  - Integrated the `amp-consent` extension to manage user consent.
  - Developed a comprehensive cookie consent interface that allows for detailed consent management based on specific purposes.
  - Implemented CSS styles for the consent interface.
  - Incorporated the consent interface into the default layout, ensuring its visibility upon page load.
  - Enabled the consent UI when `consent: true` is set in the `_config.yml` file.
  - Provided an option to remove the `data-ampdevmode` attribute from the custom script by setting `consent_dev_mode=false`.
  - Implemented blocking of AddThis, Disqus, Google Analytics, and Google AdSense until user consent is obtained.

### üîß Chore

- Extended the import of the `amp-script` extension to include cases where the consent UI is enabled, allowing custom scripts to access consent states stored locally.
- Updated to the latest official Google Analytics 4 support.
