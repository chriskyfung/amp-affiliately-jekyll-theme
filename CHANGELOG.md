## v2.9.1 (2024-03-12)

### üêõ Fixes

- Removed the `data-ampdevmode` attribute from the `<amp-script>` component in non-development environments. This attribute was previously used to enable development-specific features, such as the ability to load scripts from a local server. However, it was found to cause unintended behavior in production environments, such as preventing scripts from running or causing validation errors. By removing this attribute in non-development environments, we ensure that AMP pages are always served with the correct configuration and that scripts are executed as intended.

### ‚ú® Features

- Introduced two new options to the site configuration:
  - `amp_optimizer`: Set to true if you run AMP Optimizer after building the Jekyll site. Defaults to false.
  - `script_hash`: A hash for the `get_stored_consentStates` script. Defaults to empty.

- Inserted a line break after each badge using `<br>` tags.
- Added `<br>` tags to create line breaks before default values.
- Enhanced table styling by applying vertical-align: top to `th` and `td` elements.
- Introduced two new CSS classes, `.blue` and `.green`, to provide additional styling options.
- Appended `.green` to inline code blocks containing the text "true".
- Appended `.blue` to inline code blocks containing non-boolean default values.
- Removed the `.plaintext` CSS class to streamline the styling.
