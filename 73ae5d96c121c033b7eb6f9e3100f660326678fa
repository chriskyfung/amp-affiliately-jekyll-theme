New Design for Navigation Bar + Fixes for Accessibility Issues (#34)

üåü MAIN CHANGES

* Refactored Navbar Menu with A11y Design üë®‚Äçü¶Ω

   - Replaced the <div> soup with <ul> and <li> elements, following the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#menu).
   - Isolated the search button and right-aligned button-like links from the ul.navbar-nav list and grouped into an adjacent sibling list with a class name .navbar-btngroup.
  - The items grouped in the .navbar-btngroup always align horizontally in a single row.
   - Enabled to update the aria-expanded attributes of submenu toggles using amp-bind, by following [this amp-bind example on AMP for WordPress (amp-wp.org)](https://amp-wp.org/documentation/playbooks/enqueuing-scripts-and-using-amp-bind/).
  - Enabled to move the focus to the first sub-item when a menu/submenu expands using [AMP tap event and focus action](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events/#*---all-elements).
  - Add limits to the height of expanded menu and submenus:

    + Hamburger menu: A max-height of `60vh on small screens only
    + Submenus (navbar layout): A max-height of `60vh on large screens only

  - Show a thin scrollbar if a menu/submenu overflows
  - Added a separator above the first item of the hamburger menu
  - Added CSS styles and media queries to responsively change the margin of menu items.
