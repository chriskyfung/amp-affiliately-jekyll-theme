**Amp Affiliately Jekyll Theme** has been updated with a new Code Block Wrapping design[^1]. This update addresses long-standing code formatting issues to enhance both readability and usability for content creators and readers.

[^1]: [PR #126](https://github.com/chriskyfung/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme/pull/126)

## The Challenge: Code Blocks in a Mobile-First World

Technical articles demand clear, consistent code presentations. However, you might have experienced the following issues[^2]:

- **Compromised Readability:** Automatic line wrapping can disrupt the natural structure of your code, diminishing its clarity and reducing the effectiveness of syntax highlighting.
- **Horizontal Scrolling Frustrations:** Long lines often force readers into uncomfortable side-scrolling, especially on mobile devices.
- **Faded Scroll Indicators:** Scrollbars may be too understated, making it hard to notice when additional content extends beyond the viewport.

[^2]: [Issue #125](https://github.com/chriskyfung/amp-affiliately-jekyll-theme/issues/125)

## Our Approach: Empowering the Reader

We’ve designed a flexible solution that puts control directly in your hands:

### **1. Code Wrap Toggle**

Our dedicated toggle button lets you choose how to view code on your screen:

- **Instant Control:** Enable or disable line wrapping with a single click, tailoring the display to your preference.
- **Smart Placement:** Integrated within a responsive header—situated neatly between the featured image and post content and aligned with the publication date—it’s both easy to find and use.
- **Smooth Operation:** Powered by AMP’s `amp-bind`, the toggle updates instantly without requiring a page reload.

**LIVE DEMO:** Visit our [Code Block]({% post_url 2017-11-28-code %}) page to see the feature in action.

### **2. Reliable Syntax Highlighting and Enhanced Scrollbar Visibility**

Every aspect has been fine-tuned to maintain the integrity of your code and improve navigation:

- **Clear Presentation:** Your code’s syntax highlighting and structured indentation remain intact, regardless of whether line wrapping is activated.
- **Eye-Catching Scrollbars:** Redesigned scroll indicators now stand out, making it easier to navigate longer code blocks while preserving an elegant design.

## Why This Update Matters

- **For Content Creators:** Eliminate unexpected formatting issues—your code will consistently appear as intended across all devices, preserving the clarity and precision of your work.
