excerpt: Learn how to effectively use code blocks and syntax highlighting in Jekyll for better readability and presentation of your code snippets.

{% include toc.md %}

This theme supports [syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting) based on [Rouge](https://rouge-ruby.github.io/docs/), which is the default highlighter in Jekyll 3 and above. All CSS styles for syntax highlighting stores in the `amp-syntax-highlight.css` under the `_includes/css/` directory.

By default, this theme excludes the CSS styles for syntax highlighting. The AMP framework limits the total CSS styles up to 75,000 bytes per AMP page. This keeps light-weight and rendering fast.

âœ¨ Explore the recent enhancements to code presentation in the Amp Affiliately Jekyll Theme. Read the [full blog post]({% post_url 2025-03-22-code-block-wrapping-feature %}) for details.

To include the stylesheet on-demand, you need to add the following to your post's front matter:

```yaml
css:
  syntax: true
```

## Markdown Syntax

Code can be presented in the following ways:

### [Code spans](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code)

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`). For example:

<pre>The HTML `&lt;body&gt;` Element represents the content of an HTML document.</pre>

**Output:**

The HTML `<body>` Element represents the content of an HTML document.
{: style="border:1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5em"}

### [Fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)

Use three backticks (\`\`\`) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block with providing an easier way to specify the language, namely by appending the language of the code block to the end of the starting line. For example:

<pre>
```ruby
def what?
  42
end
```
</pre>

**Output:**

```ruby
def what?
  42
end
```

### [Use **highlight** tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting)

For example:

<pre>
{% raw %}{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}
</pre>

**Output:**

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

### [Include line numbers](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#line-numbers)

Including the `linenos` argument will force the highlighted code to include line numbers.

<pre>
{% raw %}{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}
</pre>

**Output:**

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

More information about code highlighting in jekyll can be found in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting) and [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#code-spans) documentation.

### Embedding gists

A gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. To embed a gist in your markdown file, you need to use the `<amp-gist>` component in your markdown file. You will also need to set the following in front matter of a page or post that contains the `<amp-gist>` component:

   ```yaml
   amp:
     gist: true
   ```

To embed an entire gist, you need to:

- Specify the `data-gistid` attribute with the ID of the gist you want to embed.
- Specify the `layout` and `height` attributes for the component.

For example, to embed the gist with the ID `a1b2c3d4`, you can use the following code:

```html
<amp-gist data-gistid="a1b2c3d4" layout="fixed-height" height="300"></amp-gist>
```

To embed one file out of a gist, you need to:

- Specify the `data-file` attribute with the name of the file you want to embed.
- Specify the `data-gistid`, `layout`, and `height` attributes as before.

For example, to embed the file `hello.py` from the gist with the ID `a1b2c3d4`, you can use the following code:

```html
<amp-gist data-gistid="a1b2c3d4" data-file="hello.py" layout="fixed-height" height="300"></amp-gist>
```

To learn more about the `<amp-gist>` component, you can visit the official documentation on <https://amp.dev/documentation/components/websites/amp-gist>.

## More Samples

There are a couple of examples showing the resulting highlighted code:

### HTML Code Sample

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### CSS Code Sample

```css
#container {
    float: left;
    margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### JavaScript Code Sample

```javascript
$.ajax({
  type: 'POST',
  url: 'backend.php',
  data: "q="+myform.serialize(),
  success: function(data){
    // on success use return data here
  },
  error: function(xhr, type, exception) {
    // if ajax fails display error alert
    alert("ajax error response type "+type);
  }
});
```
