    ]
    ```

This `frontmatter.json` file provides a comprehensive configuration for managing content in your Jekyll project using Front Matter CMS in VS Code, enabling efficient content management and customization.

## 4. Breakdown of `external.js`

The `external.js` file is designed to extend the functionality of the Front Matter CMS by registering custom behavior for rendering images in card footers. Here’s a breakdown of its components:

- **Imports**:
  - **`registerCardImage`**: A function from the Front Matter extensibility library used to register custom image rendering behavior.
  - **`enableDevelopmentMode`**: An optional function that can be enabled for development purposes (commented out by default).

  ```javascript
  import { registerCardImage, enableDevelopmentMode } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@frontmatter/extensibility/+esm";
  // enableDevelopmentMode();
  ```

- **registerCardImage Function**: This function is used to register a custom image rendering behavior for the card footer in Front Matter CMS.
  - The function returns an HTML string that renders an image based on the provided metadata. It checks if the `fmPreviewImage` metadata is available; if not, it falls back to the path specified in the `metadata.image.path` or a default image.

  ```javascript
  registerCardImage(async (filePath, metadata) => {
      const image = metadata.fmPreviewImage ? metadata.fmPreviewImage : metadata.image.path ? metadata.fmWebviewUrl + metadata.image.path : `${metadata.fmWebviewUrl}/assets/images/write-2160925.svg`;
      return `<img src="${image}" alt="${metadata.title}" style="object-fit: cover; margin: auto auto" class="h-36" />`;
  });
  ```

This script enhances the visual presentation of cards in the Front Matter CMS by dynamically rendering images based on the metadata associated with each file.
