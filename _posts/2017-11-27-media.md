### Images (Markdown)

You should **AVOID**{: style="color:red;" } using Markdown to add an image. Otherwise, you will get the following AMP validation error:

```shell
The tag 'img' may only appear as a descendant of tag 'noscript'. Did you mean 'amp-img'?
```

### Images in AMP

For AMP pages, you need to display an image with the `<amp-img>` tag.

You can use inline HTML to add an image in Jekyll, like is:

```html
<amp-img src="/YOUR_BASE_URL/PATH/FILENAME.jpg" \
    width="IMG_WIDTH" height="IMG_HEIGHT" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
```

**Sample:**
<amp-img src="{{ "assets/images/science-in-hd-37-obwmRiAI-unsplash_1024x683.jpg" | relative_url }}" width="1024" height="683" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

I know that you absolutely don't want to type in this way because it is easy to make mistakes.

Therefore, I created the `picture.html` as the template for you to include images in AMP valid format properly and quickly.

### Using `picture.html` Template

The `picture.html` is an integrated image container in AMP designed for supporting lightbox and WebP image with fallback. It bundles the `amp-img` component with `figure`, `figcaption`, and `<a>` elements to provide rich features. You can configure caption, classes, hyperlink, layout, Alt text, and source directory.

The basic usage:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include picture.html img="FILENAME.jpg" width="IMG_WIDTH" height="IMG_HEIGHT" %}
{% endraw %}
```

Options:

- **alt** (_if not specific, `Image in <YOUR_POST_TITLE>` will be automatically generated as the Alt text for SEO purpose_)
- **caption** (_support HTML codes_)
- **class** (_e.g._ `text-center`)
- **layout** (_amp-img supported layouts_: `fill`, `fixed`, `fixed-height`, `flex-item`, `intrinsic`, `nodisplay` or `responsive`. _default_: `intrinsic`)
- **lightbox** (_default_: `true`)
- **link** (_assign a URL for the HTML \<a\> tag that wraps the \<amp-img\> tag when the key is present_)
- **source** (`assets`, `projects` or `raw`)
  - _default_ - get image from the `/images/posts/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.default` in `_config.yml`)
  - `assets` - get image from the `/assets/images/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.assets` in `_config.yml`)
  - `projects` - get image from the `/images/projects/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.projects` in `_config.yml`)
  - `raw` - get image from the specified URL

Sample:
{% include picture.html source="assets" img="lucas-vasques-9vnACvX2748-unsplash_1024x683.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Photo captured during office hours of a company in Brazil." %}

#### Image with Caption

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include picture.html ... caption="__descriptions__<br>__attributions__" %}
{% endraw %}
```

Sample:

{% include picture.html source="assets" img="science-in-hd-N4-deIU3kQI-unsplash_1024x682.jpg" width="1024" height="682" layout="responsive" caption='NREL researcher holds a perovskite ink painted cell. NREL researchers have developed an interdigitated back contact solar cell design in which the metals and transport materials are solution processed by either ink jet or spray coating. Combined with a perovskite ink formulation with a low boiling point (<80 C) allows "paintable" solar cells.<br><span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@scienceinhd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Science in HD</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>' %}

#### Image with Link

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include picture.html ... link="DESTINATION_URL" %}
{% endraw %}
```

Sample:

{% include picture.html source="assets" img="science-in-hd-NP6JLl_2C-c-unsplash_1024x683.jpg" width="1024" height="683" layout="responsive" caption='<span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@scienceinhd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Science in HD</a> on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210807153741/https://unsplash.com/photos/37-obwmRiAI?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>' link="http://web.archive.org/web/20210128032013/https://unsplash.com/photos/NP6JLl_2C-c" %}

### YouTube Videos

This theme fully supports embedding YouTube videos, allowing you to easily integrate video content into your pages.

To enable YouTube embeds, include the following front-matter variable:

```yaml
amp:
   youtube: true
```

To embed a single video, use the following tag to include the `youtube.html` template.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include youtube.html id="VIDEO_ID" title="VIDEO_TITLE" %}
{% endraw %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_
- **indent** - _optional_

Example Video:
{% include youtube.html id="8jumRGDgxiY" title="GSP319 Build a Website on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab | 🐱‍🏍 GCP learning tour" %}

To embed a playlist, set both the _playlist ID_ and the _ID of the first video within the playlist_.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include youtube.html id="VIDEO_ID" playlist="PLAYLIST_ID" %}
{% endraw %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **playlist** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_
- **indent** - _optional_

Example Playlist:

{% include youtube.html id="C49jYtIMAsg" playlist="PLmQ8R1QWYBV72R3JoEWzIH1onqIiai6d0" title="Demos of Qwiklabs Challenge Labs - YouTube" %}

For more details on how to use this feature, refer to the [Using AMP YouTube Components]({% post_url 2024-11-23-amp-youtube %}) page.

### Audios

By default, this theme does not include the `amp-audio` components. But you can enable the feature by adding the following to your post's front matter:

```yaml
custom_head: >-
  <script async custom-element="amp-audio" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-audio-0.1.js"></script>
```

In your post body, use inline HTML to embed audio using the `<amp-audio>` tag, e.g.:

```html
<amp-audio width="auto" height="50" src="HTTPS_URL_TO_LOAD_AUDIO">
  <div fallback>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio</div>
</amp-audio>
```

Sample:
<amp-audio width="auto" height="50"
  src="https://ia801402.us.archive.org/16/items/EDIS-SRP-0197-06/EDIS-SRP-0197-06.mp3">
  <div fallback>
    <p>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio</p>
  </div>
</amp-audio>

<br>
