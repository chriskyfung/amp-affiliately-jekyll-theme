### Image (Markdown)

You should **AVOID**{: style="color:red;" } using Markdown to add an image. Otherwise, you will get the following AMP validation error:

    The tag 'img' may only appear as a descendant of tag 'noscript'. Did you mean 'amp-img'?

### Image in AMP

For AMP pages, you need to display an image with `<amp-img>` tag.

You can use inline HTML to add an image in Jekyll, like is:
```html
<amp-img src="/YOUR_BASE_URL/PATH/FILENAME.jpg" \
    width="IMG_WIDTH" height="IMG_HEIGHT" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
```

**Sample:**
<amp-img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/science-in-hd-37-obwmRiAI-unsplash_1024x683.jpg" width="1024" height="683" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

I know that you absolutely don't want to type in this way because it is easy to make mistakes.

Therefore, I created the `picture.html` as the template for you to include images in AMP valid format properly and quickly.

### Using `include picture.html`

The `picture.html` is an integrated image container in AMP designed for supporting lightbox and WebP image with fallback. It bundles the `amp-img` component with `figure`, `figcaption`, and `<a>` elements to provide rich features. You can configure caption, classes, hyperlink, layout, Alt text and source directory.

The basic usage:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include picture.html img="<FILENAME>.jpg" width="<IMG_WIDTH>" height="<IMG_HEIGHT>" %}
{% endraw %}
```

Options:
- **alt** (_if not specific, `Image in <YOUR_POST_TITLE>` will be automatically generated as the Alt text for SEO purpose_)
- **caption** (_support HTML codes_)
- **class** (_e.g._ `text-center`)
- **layout** (_amp-img supported layouts_: `fill`, `fixed`, `fixed-height`, `flex-item`, `intrinsic`, `nodisplay` or `responsive`. _default_: `intrinsic`)
- **lightbox** (_default_: `true`)
- **link** (_assign a URL for the HTML \<a\> tag that wraps the \<amp-img\> tag when the key is present_)
- **source** (`assets`, `projects` or `raw`)
  - _default_ - get image from the `/images/posts/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.default` in `_config.yml`)
  - `assets` - get image from the `/assets/images/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.assets` in `_config.yml`)
  - `projects` - get image from the `/images/projects/` directory (, or the path configured as the `image_path.projects` in `_config.yml`)
  - `raw` - get image from the specified URL

Sample:
{% include picture.html source="assets" img="lucas-vasques-9vnACvX2748-unsplash_1024x683.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Photo captured during office hours of a company in Brazil." %}

Sample:

{% include picture.html source="assets" img="science-in-hd-N4-deIU3kQI-unsplash_1024x682.jpg" width="1024" height="682" layout="responsive" caption='NREL researcher holds a perovskite ink painted cell. NREL researchers have developed an interdigitated back contact solar cell design in which the metals and transport materials are solution processed by either ink jet or spray coating. Combined with a perovskite ink formulation with a low boiling point (<80 C) allows "paintable" solar cells.<br /><span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@scienceinhd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Science in HD</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>' %}

### Video

You need to include the following front matter variable to enable YouTube embeds.

```yaml
amp:
   youtube: true
```

**Embedding a YouTube Video**

To embed a single video, use the following tag to include the `youtube.html` template.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" %}
{% endraw %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_

Sample:

{% include youtube.html id="8jumRGDgxiY" %}

<br />

**Embedding a YouTube Playlist**

To embed a playlist, you need to set both the _playlist ID_ and the _ID of first video within the playlist_.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include youtube.html id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_UID>" playlist="<YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_UID>" %}
{% endraw %}
```

- **id** - _required_
- **playlist** - _required_
- **title** - _optional_

### Audio

By default, this theme does not include the `amp-audio` components. But you can enable the feature by adding the following to your post's front matter:

```html
<script async custom-element="amp-audio" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-audio-0.1.js"></script>
```

In your post body, use inline HTML to embed an audio using the \<amp-audio\> tag, e.g.:

```html
<amp-audio width="auto" height="50" src="<HTTPS_URL_TO_LOAD__AUDIO>">
  <div fallback>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio</div>
</amp-audio>
```

Sample:
<amp-audio width="auto" height="50"
  src="https://ia801402.us.archive.org/16/items/EDIS-SRP-0197-06/EDIS-SRP-0197-06.mp3">
  <div fallback>
    <p>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio</p>
  </div>
</amp-audio>
